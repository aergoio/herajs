Welcome to herajs's documentation!
==================================

Herajs is the JavaScript implementation of hera. What's hera?
Hera is a goddess from ancient Greek mythology who protects the `Argo <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argo>`_ ship.
We use the name hera for all the aergo clients.
Currently, there is herajs, heraj, and herapy. They all implement similar API but with language-specific different styles.
